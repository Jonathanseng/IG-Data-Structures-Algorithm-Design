# in creating a stack we borrow both of the form of the array [] and its members
# Here are their operations
# The functions associated with stack are:
# empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity: O(1)
# size() – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
# top() / peek() – Returns a reference to the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
# push(a) – Inserts the element ‘a’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
# pop() – Deletes the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
